**wagmi** is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum. wagmi makes it easy to "Connect Wallet," display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more — all with caching, request deduplication, and persistence.

## Overview

```tsx
import { WagmiConfig, createClient } from 'wagmi'

const client = createClient()

function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiConfig client={client}>
      <Profile />
    </WagmiConfig>
  )
}
```

```tsx
import { useAccount, useConnect, useDisconnect } from 'wagmi'
import { InjectedConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/injected'

function Profile() {
  const { data } = useAccount()
  const { connect } = useConnect({
    connector: new InjectedConnector(),
  })
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect()

  if (data)
    return (
      <div>
        Connected to {data.address}
        <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</button>
      </div>
    )
  return <button onClick={() => connect()}>Connect Wallet</button>
}
```

In this example, we create a wagmi `Client` and pass it to the React Context `Provider`. Next, we use the `useConnect` hook to connect an injected wallet (e.g. MetaMask) to the app. Finally, we show the connected account's address with `useAccount` and allow them to disconnect with `useDisconnect`.

We've only scratched the surface for what you can do with wagmi!
