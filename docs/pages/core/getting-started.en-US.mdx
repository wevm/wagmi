# Getting Started

## Installation

Install `@wagmi/core` and its ethers peer dependency.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm i @wagmi/core ethers
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
pnpm i @wagmi/core ethers
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn add @wagmi/core ethers
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Configure chains

First, configure your desired chains to be used by wagmi, and the providers you want to use.

```ts
import { configureChains, mainnet } from '@wagmi/core'
import { publicProvider } from '@wagmi/core/providers/public'

const { chains, provider, webSocketProvider } = configureChains(
  [mainnet],
  [publicProvider()],
)
```

This example uses the Ethereum Mainnet chain (`mainnet`) from `@wagmi/core`, however, you can also pass in any [EVM-compatible chain](/core/chains#wagmichains).

Note: In a production app, it is not recommended to only pass `publicProvider` to `configureChains` as you will probably face rate-limiting on the public provider endpoints. It is recommended to also pass an [`alchemyProvider`](/core/providers/alchemy) or [`infuraProvider`](/core/providers/infura) as well.

[Read more about configuring chains](/core/providers/configuring-chains)

### Create a wagmi client

Next, create a wagmi `Client` instance using [`createClient`](/core/client), and pass the result from `configureChains` to it.

```ts {14-18}
import {
  createClient,
  configureChains,
  mainnet,
} from '@wagmi/core'
import { publicProvider } from '@wagmi/core/providers/public'

const { chains, provider, webSocketProvider } = configureChains(
  [mainnet],
  [publicProvider()],
)

const client = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  provider,
  webSocketProvider,
})
```

### You're good to go!

Use actions! You can now import and use actions throughout your app.

```ts {4-6,7}
import { connect, fetchEnsName } from '@wagmi/core'
import { InjectedConnector } from '@wagmi/core/connectors/injected'

const { address } = await connect({
  connector: new InjectedConnector(),
})
const ensName = await fetchEnsName({ address })
```
