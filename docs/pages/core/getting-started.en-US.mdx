# Getting Started

`@wagmi/core` is a VanillaJS library containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum. It makes it easy to "Connect Wallet," display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more.

## Installation

Install `@wagmi/core` and its [viem](https://viem.sh) peer dependency.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm i @wagmi/core viem
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
pnpm i @wagmi/core viem
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn add @wagmi/core viem
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Configure chains

First, configure your desired chains to be used by wagmi, and the providers you want to use.

```ts
import { configureChains, mainnet } from '@wagmi/core'
import { publicProvider } from '@wagmi/core/providers/public'

const { chains, publicClient, webSocketPublicClient } = configureChains(
  [mainnet],
  [publicProvider()],
)
```

This example uses the Ethereum Mainnet chain (`mainnet`) from `@wagmi/core`, however, you can also pass in any [EVM-compatible chain](/core/chains#wagmichains).

Note: In a production app, it is not recommended to only pass `publicProvider` to `configureChains` as you will probably face rate-limiting on the public provider endpoints. It is recommended to also pass an [`alchemyProvider`](/core/providers/alchemy) or [`infuraProvider`](/core/providers/infura) as well.

## Create a wagmi client

Next, create a wagmi `Client` instance using [`createClient`](/core/client), and pass the result from `configureChains` to it.

```ts {14-18}
import {
  createClient,
  configureChains,
  mainnet,
} from '@wagmi/core'
import { publicProvider } from '@wagmi/core/providers/public'

const { chains, publicClient, webSocketPublicClient } = configureChains(
  [mainnet],
  [publicProvider()],
)

const client = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  publicClient,
  webSocketPublicClient,
})
```

## You're good to go!

Use actions! You can now import and use actions throughout your app.

```ts {4-6,7}
import { connect, fetchEnsName } from '@wagmi/core'
import { InjectedConnector } from '@wagmi/core/connectors/injected'

const { address } = await connect({
  connector: new InjectedConnector(),
})
const ensName = await fetchEnsName({ address })
```
