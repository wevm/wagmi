# watchBlockNumber

Action for subscribing to [block number](/core/actions/fetchBlockNumber) changes.

```ts
import { watchBlockNumber } from '@wagmi/core'
```

## Usage

By default, the callback will be invoked when the Public Client changes.

```ts
import { watchBlockNumber } from '@wagmi/core'

const unwatch = watchBlockNumber(
  {
    chainId: 1,
  },
  (blockNumber) => console.log(blockNumber),
)
```

## Return Value

`unwatch` is a function that can be called to unsubscribe from the block number change event.

## Configuration

### chainId (optional)

Force a specific chain id for the request. The wagmi `Client`'s `publicClient` must be set up as a [chain-aware function](/core/client#publicclient-optional) for this to work correctly.

```ts {5}
import { watchBlockNumber } from '@wagmi/core'

const unwatch = watchBlockNumber(
  {
    chainId: 1,
  },
  (blockNumber) => console.log(blockNumber),
)
```

### listen (optional)

Listen to network for block number changes.

```ts {5}
import { watchBlockNumber } from '@wagmi/core'

const unwatch = watchBlockNumber(
  {
    listen: true,
  },
  (blockNumber) => console.log(blockNumber),
)
```
