# TypeScript

wagmi is designed to be as type-safe as possible! Things to keep in mind:

- Types currently require using TypeScript v4.7.4 or greater.
- Changes to types in this repository are considered non-breaking and are usually released as patch semver changes (otherwise every type enhancement would be a major version!).
- It is highly recommended that you lock your `wagmi` package version to a specific patch release and upgrade with the expectation that types may be fixed or upgraded between any release.
- The non-type-related public API of wagmi still follows semver very strictly.

To ensure everything works correctly, make sure that your `tsconfig.json` has [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) mode set to true:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Type Inference

wagmi can infer types based on [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/abi-spec.html#json) and [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) Typed Data definitions (powered by [ABIType](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/abitype)), giving you full end-to-end type-safety from your contracts to your frontend and incredible developer experience (e.g. autocomplete ABI function names and catch misspellings, type ABI function arguments, etc.).

For this to work, you must either add [const assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions) to specific configuration parameters (more info on those below) or define them inline. For example, `useContractRead`'s `abi` configuration parameter:

```ts
const { data } = useContractRead({
  abi: […], // <--- defined inline
})
```

```ts
const abi = […] as const // <--- const assertion
const { data } = useContractRead({ abi })
```

If type inference isn't working, it's likely you forgot to add a `const` assertion or define the configuration parameter inline.

<Callout type="info">
  Unfortunately [TypeScript doesn't support importing JSON as
  const](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32063). Check out
  [`@wagmi/cli`](/cli) to help with this! It can automatically fetch ABIs from
  Etherscan, resolve ABIs from your Foundry/Hardhat projects, generate React
  Hooks, and much more.

### Contract ABIs

The following hooks support type inference when you add a const assertion to `abi`:

- [useContract](/react/hooks/useContract)
- [useContractEvent](/react/hooks/useContractEvent)
- [useContractRead](/react/hooks/useContractRead)
- [useContractReads](/react/hooks/useContractReads)
- [useContractWrite](/react/hooks/useContractWrite)
- [usePrepareContractWrite](/react/prepare-hooks/usePrepareContractWrite)
- [useContractInfiniteReads](/react/hooks/useContractInfiniteReads) (must also add const assertion to `args` since `abi` is in the return type)

For example, `useContractRead`:

```ts
import { useContractRead } from 'wagmi'

const { data } = useContractRead({
  //    ^? const data: bigint | undefined
  address: '0xecb504d39723b0be0e3a9aa33d646642d1051ee1',
  abi: [
    {
      name: 'getUncleanliness',
      inputs: [],
      outputs: [{ name: '', type: 'uint256' }],
      stateMutability: 'view',
      type: 'function',
    },
    {
      name: 'love',
      inputs: [{ name: '', type: 'address' }],
      outputs: [{ name: '', type: 'uint256' }],
      stateMutability: 'view',
      type: 'function',
    },
    {
      name: 'play',
      inputs: [],
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
      type: 'function',
    },
  ],

  functionName: 'love',
  // ^? (property) functionName?: "getUncleanliness" | "love" | undefined
  // Notice how "play" is not included since it is not a "read" function

  args: ['0x27a69ffba1e939ddcfecc8c7e0f967b872bac65c'],
  // ^? (property) args?: readonly [`0x${string}`] | undefined

  onSuccess(data) {
    //      ^? (parameter) data: bigint
  },
  // Type inference flows to other configuration parameters as well:
  // - select?: ((data: bigint) => bigint) | undefined
  // - onSettled?: ((data: bigint | undefined, error: Error | null) => void) | undefined
  // - …
})
```

### EIP-712 Typed Data

Adding a const assertion to `types` adds type inference to `useSignTypedData`'s `value` configuration parameter:

```ts
import { useSignTypedData } from 'wagmi'

const result = useSignTypedData({
  domain: {
    name: 'Ether Mail',
    version: '1',
    chainId: 1,
    verifyingContract: '0xCcCCccccCCCCcCCCCCCcCcCccCcCCCcCcccccccC',
  },

  types: {
    Person: [
      { name: 'name', type: 'string' },
      { name: 'wallet', type: 'address' },
    ],
    Mail: [
      { name: 'from', type: 'Person' },
      { name: 'to', type: 'Person' },
      { name: 'contents', type: 'string' },
    ],
  },

  value: {
    // ^? (parameter) value?: { name: string; wallet: `0x${string}` } | {
    //     from: {
    //         name: string;
    //         wallet: `0x${string}`;
    //     };
    //     to: {
    //         name: string;
    //         wallet: `0x${string}`;
    //     };
    //     contents: string;
    // } | undefined
    from: {
      name: 'Cow',
      wallet: '0xCD2a3d9F938E13CD947Ec05AbC7FE734Df8DD826',
    },
    to: {
      name: 'Bob',
      wallet: '0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB',
    },
    contents: 'Hello, Bob!',
  },
})
```

## Configuring Internal Types

For advanced use-cases, you may want to configure wagmi's internal types. Most of wagmi's types relating to ABIs and EIP-712 Typed Data are powered by [ABIType](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/abitype). See ABIType's [documentation](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/abitype#configuration) for more info on how to configure types.
