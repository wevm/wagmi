            Hello @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}. 

            Please provide a [minimal reproduction](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) using [StackBlitz](https://new.wagmi.sh), [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) (for type issues), or a separate minimal GitHub repository.

            Minimal reproductions are required as they save us a lot of time reproducing your config & environment, and trying to reproduce your issue. See [Why reproductions are required](https://antfu.me/posts/why-reproductions-are-required). 

            Please reopen this issue when a reproduction is added.
