      label: Link to Minimal Reproducible Example
      description: Please provide a link via [new.wagmi.sh](https://new.wagmi.sh) or a link to a minimal repository that can reproduce the problem. This makes investigating issues and helping you out significantly easier! For most issues, you will likely get asked to provide a minimal reproducible example so why not add one now :) If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a "needs reproduction" label. If no reproduction is provided after 3 days, it will be auto-closed.
