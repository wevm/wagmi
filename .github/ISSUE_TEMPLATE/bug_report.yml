For most issues, you will likely get asked to provide a minimal reproducible example so why not add one now :) If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a \"needs reproduction\" label. If no reproduction is provided after 3 days, it will be auto-closed."
