# Why Wagmi

Please see the [React "Why Wagmi"](/react/why) page for more information on the rationale behind the Wagmi project. The same principles apply to `@wagmi/solid`.

## Why Solid?

[Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) is a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It compiles templates to real DOM nodes and updates them with fine-grained reactions. Solid combines the best ideas from React, Vue, and Svelte while providing excellent performance and a small bundle size.

`@wagmi/solid` brings the same great developer experience from Wagmi to Solid applications, allowing you to build Ethereum applications with Solid's reactive primitives.
